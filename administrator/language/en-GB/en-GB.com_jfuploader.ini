E_D_JFU_USE_JS_INCLUDE="In the frontend the flash is included by Javascript by default to avoid that users of 'older' versions of IE have to activate the flash. But sometimes this way interferes with other components. If you get an error message that the web site cannot be opened when you try to open JFU you should set this to false. JFU is then included with the good old object tag. Test with Vista and IE with 'Protected Mode: On'. If this works with Javascript everything is fine otherwise use the object tag."

H_H_OVERVIEW="<b>Overview:</b> The JFUploader (JFU) is a Joomla component that allows you to provide a very comfortable way to upload files with flash both in the backend AND the front-end of Joomla. You don't have to upload one file after another anymore but you can upload them all at once. You can specify different profiles and assign them to your users in Joomla. This makes it possible to give e.g. every user a different upload folder with even different settings!"
H_H_HELP="<b>Help:</b> If the description on the pages are not enough click on the 'Help' button in the toolbar. This shows you always the latest help. It is only available in English right now but it should explain everything you need to know."
H_H_TWG="<b>TWG Flash Uploader:</b> JFU is a bridge to the TWG Flash Uploader where the whole configuration can be nicely made in Joomla. Therefore you can simply go to the TFU homepage to get more information what the flash can do and you get some more help there too."
H_H_FORUM="<b>Forum:</b> The TWG homepage has a <a target='_blank' href='http://www.tinywebgallery.com/en/forum.php'>forum</a> where you find an extra section for the JFU. Please report any problems/comment/questions there."
H_H_CONFIG="<b>Extended configuration:</b> The JFU configuration covers about 98% of the possible settings (and 100% of the important ones). If you open the my_tfu_config.php in administration/components/com_jfuploader/tfu you find the remaining ones as comments. The file is well documented. Therefore it should not be a problem to make your changes of the remaining settings there."
H_H_MAMBOT="<b>Mambots/Plugin:</b> There is a Mambot/Plugin available. It needs a working component if you like to use it. A description can be found in the help."
